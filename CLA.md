# Aathman Contributor License Agreements (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Aathman Core**.

To protect both contributors and maintainers, all code contributions require
a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This ensures that contributed
code can be used in the open-source Aathman Core as well as in the commercial
Aathman Enterprise edition.



## Individual Contributors (ICLA)

If you are contributing as an individual, please review and sign:

**ICLA (PDF)**: https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf



## Corporate Contributors (CCLA)

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, the organization must sign:

**CCLA (PDF)**: https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.pdf


For corporate contributors: Please have your organization review and sign
the official Apache Corporate CLA (CCLA) and send a signed copy to
chethan.da.1715@gmail.com.



## How Signing Works

When you submit your first pull request, our automatic CLA system will
prompt you to sign the appropriate agreement. You only need to sign once.

After signing, all future pull requests will be automatically verified.

If your employer needs to sign the CCLA, please contact us so we can
coordinate the signature process.



## Questions?

If you have any questions about the CLA or contribution process,
please contact the maintainers:
